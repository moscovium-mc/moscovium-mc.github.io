My work sits at the intersection of building scalable, production-ready applications and developing practical tools for penetration testing, OSINT, and security automation.</p> <p>On the web development side, I specialize in designing and implementing end-to-end applications, from responsive front-end interfaces to robust back-end services. I’m proficient in React, Next.js, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, with experience deploying and maintaining applications on platforms such as Netlify and Vercel. I prioritize clean architecture, maintainable codebases, and developer-friendly workflows.</p> <p>In security research, my focus is on offensive security and tool development. I primarily work with Python and Bash to create penetration testing utilities, OSINT reconnaissance tools, and automated security assessment frameworks. My work includes credential exposure analysis, Cloudflare and WAF reconnaissance, vulnerability research, and building scalable tooling for real-world security assessments. I maintain and contribute to multiple open-source security tools and actively engage with the infosec community.</p> </body></html>
