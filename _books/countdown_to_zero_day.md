A gripping investigation into Stuxnet, the world's first digital weapon that physically destroyed centrifuges in Iran's nuclear facilities. Award-winning journalist Kim Zetter provides a detailed account of how security researchers discovered and analyzed this unprecedented cyber weapon, revealing the new era of digital warfare.

The book reads like a thriller while maintaining journalistic rigor, chronicling the discovery of Stuxnet in 2010 and tracing its origins to a joint US-Israeli operation. Zetter explains complex technical concepts in accessible terms, showing how this sophisticated malware exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to achieve its mission.

Through extensive research and interviews with key figures in cybersecurity, Zetter explores the implications of state-sponsored cyberattacks and how Stuxnet opened Pandora's box, setting precedents for future cyber warfare. The narrative raises critical questions about the ethics and consequences of digital weapons in modern conflict.
