A hands-on guide to penetration testing that approaches cybersecurity from an offensive perspective. Peter Kim uses sports analogies to make complex hacking techniques accessible, presenting penetration testing as a game with specific plays and strategies. This third edition includes updated tools, techniques, and real-world scenarios.

The book covers the full spectrum of penetration testing, from reconnaissance and scanning to exploitation and post-exploitation. Kim provides practical exercises and labs that allow readers to practice techniques in controlled environments, making it invaluable for aspiring penetration testers and security professionals.

Unlike purely theoretical texts, The Hacker Playbook emphasizes practical application with step-by-step instructions for using popular tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and custom scripts. The author shares lessons learned from actual engagements, offering insights into how attackers think and operate in real-world scenarios.
