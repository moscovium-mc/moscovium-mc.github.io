## The Ultimate Cybercrime Thriller

Former hacker Kevin Poulsen delivers a gripping cat-and-mouse narrative that provides an unprecedented view into the twenty-first century's signature form of organized crime. With unmatched access and expertise, Poulsen tells the story of Max 'Vision' Butler—the most unlikely of criminals.

## The Story

The word spread through the hacking underground like some unstoppable new virus: Someone had just staged a hostile takeover of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars from the US economy.

The FBI rushed to launch an ambitious undercover operation aimed at tracking down this new kingpin. Yet at every turn, their main quarry displayed a seemingly uncanny ability to sniff out their snitches and see through their plots.

The culprit was a brilliant programmer with a hippie ethic and a supervillain's double identity. As prominent 'white hat' hacker Max 'Vision' Butler, he was a celebrity throughout the programming world and even served as a consultant for the FBI. But as the black-hat 'Iceman,' he infiltrated thousands of computers around the country, sucking down millions of credit card numbers at will.

## Why This Book Matters

Through remarkable rise and law enforcement's quest to track him down, *Kingpin* lays bare the workings of a silent crime wave still affecting millions of Americans. We are ushered into vast online-fraud supermarkets stocked with credit card numbers, counterfeit checks, hacked bank accounts, and fake passports.

Poulsen's background as both a former hacker (who served over 5 years in prison) and an investigative journalist at WIRED gives him unique insight into this underworld. No other author could have written this book with such authenticity and technical accuracy.

## What Makes It Exceptional

**Technical Accuracy**: Unlike most cybercrime books, Poulsen gets the technical details right. His descriptions of SQL injection attacks, browser exploits, and phishing campaigns are both accurate and accessible.

**Character Depth**: Emerges as a complex, conflicted figure—brilliant yet self-destructive, idealistic yet criminal. The book explores what drives someone with extraordinary talent to choose crime over legitimate success.

**Law Enforcement Perspective**: With unprecedented access to FBI agents and prosecutors, Poulsen shows both sides of the cat-and-mouse game, revealing the innovative techniques investigators use to track cybercriminals.

## Critical Acclaim

> "A milestone in the anthropology of hacking, up there with Steven Levy's *Hackers*... what will make this book endure is Poulsen's elegant elucidation of how the hacking world evolved from its pimply, ideological beginnings into a global criminal enterprise." —*The Atlantic*

> "True crime doesn't get much better than this: a thrilling account... Kingpin gives us not just the personalities and double-dealing of this new underground, but also a look at how hacking has transformed the world of crime." —*Barnes & Noble*

> "Kevin Poulsen's reporting is first class: the book contains fascinating details of the FBI's investigative techniques and the scams and other hackers ran. It's not easy to write a gripping passage about a database query language, but Poulsen pulls it off." —*New Scientist*

## My Take

*Kingpin* reads like a Michael Mann crime thriller but it's all true. Poulsen masterfully weaves together multiple storylines—rise to power, the FBI's investigation, the internecine warfare among hackers—into a narrative that's both educational and pulse-pounding.

What sets this apart from other cybercrime books is Poulsen's insider knowledge. He understands hacker culture from the inside, having lived it himself. This allows him to capture not just what hackers do, but why they do it—the psychology, the rivalries, the strange code of ethics in a lawless world.

For anyone interested in cybersecurity, computer crime, or just a damn good true crime story, *Kingpin* is essential reading. It's both a warning about our vulnerable digital infrastructure and a portrait of the brilliant, troubled individuals who exploit it.

## Who Should Read This

- Cybersecurity professionals wanting to understand real-world attacks
- True crime enthusiasts looking for 21st-century stories
- Anyone curious about how credit card theft actually works
- Readers who enjoyed *The Big Short* or *Bad Blood*—tales of complex systems and the people who game them

This isn't just a book about hacking—it's a book about ambition, identity, and the strange parallel universe that exists just beneath the surface of the internet we all use every day.
