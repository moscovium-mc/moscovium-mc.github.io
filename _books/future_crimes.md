A sobering examination of the dark side of technological innovation and the emerging threats in our increasingly connected world. Marc Goodman, a global security advisor and futurist, explores how criminals, terrorists, and rogue states are exploiting technology for malicious purposes, from the Internet of Things to artificial intelligence.

The book presents a comprehensive overview of modern cyber threats, including data breaches, identity theft, ransomware, and the vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. Goodman draws on his experience with law enforcement and cybersecurity to illustrate how rapidly evolving technology outpaces our ability to secure it.

Through vivid examples and case studies, the author reveals the hidden dangers lurking in everyday technologies—from smartphones to medical devices to self-driving cars. Despite the alarming scenarios, Goodman offers practical solutions and actionable steps individuals and organizations can take to protect themselves in the digital age.
