A chilling investigation into Russia's most dangerous hacker group and their campaign of cyberattacks that have targeted critical infrastructure worldwide. Andy Greenberg, a senior writer at WIRED, chronicles the rise of Sandworm, a unit of Russian military intelligence responsible for some of the most devastating cyberattacks in history.

The book details the NotPetya attack that caused billions in damages globally, the blackouts in Ukraine that left hundreds of thousands without power, and attempts to disrupt the 2018 Winter Olympics. Greenberg weaves together technical analysis with geopolitical context, showing how cyberwarfare has become a tool of modern statecraft.

Through extensive reporting and interviews with cybersecurity researchers, government officials, and victims, the author reveals the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders. Sandworm serves as both a cybersecurity thriller and a warning about the vulnerabilities in our interconnected infrastructure and the real-world consequences of digital warfare.
