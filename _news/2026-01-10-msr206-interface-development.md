Working on a custom software interface for the MSR206 magnetic stripe reader/writer device. Despite being an older technology, the MSR206 remains widely popular and actively used in various industries. This new interface aims to modernize the user experience while maintaining full compatibility with legacy systems and expanding functionality for security research and testing purposes.

The project includes:
- Modern cross-platform GUI application
- Enhanced device communication protocols
- Comprehensive track data management
- Security-focused features for ethical research
- Full documentation and developer support

This development represents my ongoing commitment to bridging legacy technology with modern security requirements.
