Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, often representing the most effective attack vector against organizations.

### Common Techniques

Social engineers employ various methods:

- **Phishing** - Deceptive emails requesting sensitive information
- **Pretexting** - Creating fabricated scenarios to gain trust
- **Baiting** - Offering something enticing to trigger malicious action
- **Quid Pro Quo** - Offering service in exchange for information
- **Tailgating** - Following authorized personnel into restricted areas
- **Vishing** - Voice phishing via phone calls

### Psychological Principles

These attacks leverage:

1. **Authority** - People tend to obey authority figures
2. **Urgency** - Time pressure reduces critical thinking
3. **Scarcity** - Limited opportunities create desire
4. **Social Proof** - People follow others' actions
5. **Reciprocity** - People feel obligated to return favors
6. **Consistency** - People want to appear consistent with prior statements

### Defense Strategies

Organizations should implement:

- **Security Awareness Training** - Regular education on social engineering tactics
- **Verification Procedures** - Multi-factor confirmation for sensitive requests
- **Clear Policies** - Documented procedures for handling sensitive information
- **Simulated Attacks** - Testing employee awareness with controlled exercises
- **Reporting Mechanisms** - Easy ways to report suspicious activity

### Red Flags

Employees should watch for:

- Unexpected requests for credentials or sensitive information
- Communications creating artificial urgency
- Requests deviating from normal procedures
- Unusual sender addresses or phone numbers
- Poor grammar or formatting in official-looking communications

### Incident Response

When social engineering succeeds:

- Contain the incident immediately
- Change compromised credentials
- Assess the scope of information disclosure
- Notify affected parties as required
- Review and improve defenses

Human factors remain the weakest link in many security programs, making ongoing education and awareness critical components of organizational security.
