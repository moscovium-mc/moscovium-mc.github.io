Browser security is an ongoing arms race between defenders implementing protections and attackers discovering new vulnerabilities. JavaScript engines represent a particularly complex attack surface.

### Common JavaScript Attack Vectors

Browser exploits often target:

- **Memory Corruption** - Buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities
- **Type Confusion** - Exploiting type system weaknesses
- **Just-In-Time Compilation** - JIT spray and JIT exploitation
- **DOM Manipulation** - Bypassing same-origin policies

### Security Research Ethics

Responsible vulnerability research involves:

1. **Obtaining Permission** - Testing only on systems you own or have authorization to test
2. **Coordinated Disclosure** - Reporting findings to vendors before public release
3. **Proof of Concept Restraint** - Avoiding weaponization of exploits
4. **Community Contribution** - Sharing knowledge to improve overall security

### Browser Hardening

Users can reduce attack surface by:

- Disabling JavaScript when not needed
- Using script blockers like NoScript
- Keeping browsers updated
- Running in sandboxed environments
- Using hardened browser configurations

Security research plays a vital role in improving software security, but must be conducted ethically and responsibly to benefit the broader community.
