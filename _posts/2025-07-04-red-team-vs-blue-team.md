Security teams often organize into specialized roles focusing on either attacking (Red Team) or defending (Blue Team) systems, with increasing emphasis on collaboration.

### Red Team Responsibilities

Red Teams simulate real attackers:

- **Reconnaissance** - Gathering information about targets
- **Weaponization** - Creating tools and techniques for attacks
- **Delivery** - Deploying attacks against systems
- **Exploitation** - Gaining access and executing code
- **Installation** - Establishing persistence on compromised systems
- **Command and Control** - Maintaining access and control
- **Actions on Objectives** - Achieving mission goals

**Red Team Tools:**
- Metasploit Framework
- Cobalt Strike
- Empire/PowerShell Empire
- Mimikatz
- BloodHound
- Custom malware and exploits

### Blue Team Responsibilities

Blue Teams defend against attacks:

- **Prevention** - Implementing security controls to block attacks
- **Detection** - Identifying malicious activity and intrusions
- **Response** - Containing and remediating security incidents
- **Recovery** - Restoring systems and operations after incidents
- **Threat Hunting** - Proactively searching for hidden threats
- **Monitoring** - Continuous surveillance of systems and networks

**Blue Team Tools:**
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
- Firewalls and network security devices
- Forensic analysis tools
- Threat intelligence platforms

### Purple Team Collaboration

Purple Teams bridge Red and Blue:

- **Collaborative Exercises** - Joint testing and improvement sessions
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Red teaching Blue about attack techniques
- **Tool Testing** - Evaluating detection capabilities against real attacks
- **Process Improvement** - Refining security operations based on findings
- **Training** - Cross-training team members on both sides

### Exercise Methodologies

Common testing approaches:

1. **Tabletop Exercises** - Discussion-based scenario walkthroughs
2. **Red Team Exercises** - Realistic attack simulations with limited rules of engagement
3. **Purple Team Exercises** - Collaborative testing with full transparency
4. **Capture the Flag (CTF)** - Competitive security challenges
5. **Adversary Simulation** - Emulating specific threat actors

### Metrics and Measurement

Teams track different metrics:

**Red Team Metrics:**
- Time to initial access
- Detection evasion success rate
- Lateral movement effectiveness
- Objective completion rate

**Blue Team Metrics:**
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to respond (MTTR)
- Detection coverage percentage
- False positive rate
- Incident containment time

### Building Effective Teams

Organizational considerations:

- **Clear Charters** - Defined missions and rules of engagement
- **Separation of Duties** - Avoiding conflicts of interest
- **Regular Communication** - Sharing findings and insights
- **Continuous Training** - Keeping skills current
- **Tool Standardization** - Consistent platforms and procedures
- **Executive Support** - Leadership buy-in and resources

### Career Paths

Professional development differs:

**Red Team Skills:**
- Exploit development
- Social engineering
- Physical security testing
- Advanced persistence techniques
- Evasion and anti-forensics

**Blue Team Skills:**
- Log analysis and correlation
- Incident response procedures
- Forensic investigation
- Threat intelligence analysis
- Security architecture

Both Red and Blue Team approaches are essential for comprehensive security, with increasing emphasis on collaboration through Purple Team activities to improve overall organizational resilience.
