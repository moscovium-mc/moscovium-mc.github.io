Threat intelligence transforms raw data about potential threats into actionable information that organizations can use to improve their security posture.

### Intelligence Types

Different categories serve different purposes:

- **Strategic Intelligence** - High-level trends and threat actor motivations
- **Tactical Intelligence** - Specific adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- **Operational Intelligence** - Details about specific attacks and campaigns
- **Technical Intelligence** - Indicators of compromise (IOCs) and malware signatures

### Collection Sources

Intelligence comes from various sources:

1. **Open Source** - Publicly available information (OSINT)
2. **Commercial Feeds** - Paid threat intelligence services
3. **Information Sharing** - Industry groups and ISACs
4. **Internal Data** - Organization's own security logs and incidents
5. **Human Intelligence** - Information from human sources
6. **Technical Collection** - Honeypots, sensors, and monitoring

### Analysis Process

Effective intelligence analysis involves:

- **Collection** - Gathering relevant data from multiple sources
- **Processing** - Normalizing and organizing collected information
- **Analysis** - Correlating data and identifying patterns
- **Production** - Creating actionable intelligence products
- **Dissemination** - Sharing intelligence with appropriate stakeholders
- **Feedback** - Refining based on user input and effectiveness

### Intelligence Frameworks

Common frameworks include:

- **MITRE ATT&CK** - Knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques
- **Cyber Kill Chain** - Lockheed Martin's attack lifecycle model
- **Diamond Model** - Event-based analysis framework
- **Structured Analytic Techniques** - Methods for reducing cognitive bias

### Implementation Challenges

Organizations face:

- Information overload and data volume
- Distinguishing signal from noise
- Integrating intelligence into existing tools
- Measuring intelligence effectiveness
- Resource constraints and expertise gaps

### Best Practices

Effective programs should:

- Define clear intelligence requirements
- Focus on relevance to organizational risks
- Automate collection and processing where possible
- Integrate with security operations
- Continuously evaluate and improve
- Share appropriately within trusted communities

Threat intelligence enables proactive security by providing context and foresight about potential attacks and adversaries.
