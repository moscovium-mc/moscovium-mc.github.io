Incident response is the organized approach to addressing and managing security breaches or cyberattacks to minimize damage and reduce recovery time and costs.

### NIST Framework

The NIST incident response lifecycle includes:

- **Preparation** - Developing capabilities before incidents occur
- **Detection and Analysis** - Identifying and understanding incidents
- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery** - Limiting damage and restoring operations
- **Post-Incident Activity** - Learning and improving from incidents

### Preparation Phase

Effective preparation involves:

1. **Incident Response Plan** - Documented procedures and responsibilities
2. **Team Formation** - Designated roles and contact information
3. **Tool Acquisition** - Forensic and analysis tools ready for use
4. **Training and Exercises** - Regular drills and tabletop exercises
5. **Communication Plans** - Internal and external communication procedures

### Detection and Analysis

Key activities include:

- **Monitoring** - Continuous surveillance of systems and networks
- **Alert Triage** - Prioritizing and investigating security alerts
- **Evidence Collection** - Gathering relevant data systematically
- **Impact Assessment** - Determining scope and severity
- **Classification** - Categorizing incident type and characteristics

### Containment Strategies

Containment approaches:

- **Short-term** - Immediate actions to limit damage (isolating systems, blocking IPs)
- **Long-term** - Sustained measures to maintain security during recovery
- **Evidence Preservation** - Maintaining forensic integrity throughout

### Eradication and Recovery

Recovery process involves:

- **Root Cause Removal** - Eliminating the source of the incident
- **System Restoration** - Rebuilding or cleaning affected systems
- **Validation** - Verifying systems are clean and secure
- **Monitoring** - Watching for signs of persistence or re-infection
- **Gradual Restoration** - Bringing systems back online carefully

### Post-Incident Activities

After resolution:

- **Lessons Learned** - Documenting what worked and what didn't
- **Process Improvement** - Updating procedures based on experience
- **Tool Enhancement** - Improving capabilities for future incidents
- **Reporting** - Communicating findings to stakeholders
- **Legal and Regulatory** - Meeting compliance and notification requirements

### Metrics and Measurement

Effective programs track:

- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to respond (MTTR)
- Incident frequency and types
- Containment effectiveness
- Recovery time and costs

Incident response capability separates mature security programs from reactive ones, enabling organizations to handle breaches effectively when they occur.
