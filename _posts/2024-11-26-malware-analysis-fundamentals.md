Malware analysis involves examining malicious software to understand its functionality, purpose, and potential impact on systems and networks.

### Analysis Environments

Safe analysis requires isolated environments:

- **Virtual Machines** - Snapshottable isolated systems
- **Dedicated Hardware** - Air-gapped physical systems
- **Sandbox Solutions** - Automated analysis platforms
- **Network Isolation** - Preventing malware communication

### Analysis Methodologies

Two primary approaches:

1. **Static Analysis** - Examining code without execution
   - File format analysis (PE, ELF, Mach-O headers)
   - String extraction and analysis
   - Disassembly and decompilation
   - Hash-based identification
   - YARA rule matching

2. **Dynamic Analysis** - Observing behavior during execution
   - System call monitoring
   - Network traffic analysis
   - File system changes
   - Registry modifications (Windows)
   - Process and thread behavior

### Essential Tools

Common analysis utilities:

- **Disassemblers** - IDA Pro, Ghidra, Radare2
- **Debuggers** - x64dbg, WinDbg, GDB
- **PE Tools** - PEiD, PEview, CFF Explorer
- **Sandbox Platforms** - Cuckoo, Joe Sandbox, Hybrid Analysis
- **String Tools** - strings, FLOSS (Find Strings)
- **Hex Editors** - HxD, 010 Editor

### Analysis Workflow

Systematic approach includes:

- Initial triage and classification
- Static analysis for quick insights
- Dynamic analysis in controlled environment
- Code analysis for deep understanding
- IOC (Indicator of Compromise) extraction
- Report generation with findings and recommendations

### Safety Precautions

Analysts should:

- Never analyze malware on production systems
- Use snapshots to quickly restore clean state
- Disable network access or use controlled network
- Employ multiple layers of isolation
- Maintain detailed documentation
- Follow organizational security policies

### Legal Considerations

Malware analysis requires:

- Proper authorization for possession and analysis
- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Appropriate handling of stolen or sensitive data
- Responsible disclosure of findings
- Protection of intellectual property

Malware analysis is a specialized skill requiring technical expertise, careful methodology, and strong ethical principles.
