Vulnerability management is the continuous process of discovering, prioritizing, and addressing security weaknesses in systems and applications to reduce organizational risk.

### Lifecycle Process

Effective vulnerability management includes:

- **Discovery** - Identifying assets and vulnerabilities
- **Prioritization** - Ranking vulnerabilities by risk and impact
- **Remediation** - Fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities
- **Verification** - Confirming vulnerabilities are addressed
- **Reporting** - Documenting progress and metrics

### Discovery Methods

Vulnerability identification techniques:

1. **Automated Scanning** - Using vulnerability scanners
   - Nessus
   - Qualys
   - OpenVAS
   - Nexpose
   - Rapid7 InsightVM

2. **Manual Assessment** - Expert security testing
   - Penetration testing
   - Code review
   - Architecture analysis
   - Configuration review

3. **Threat Intelligence** - Monitoring for new vulnerabilities
   - CVE databases
   - Vendor security bulletins
   - Security mailing lists
   - Bug bounty programs

### Prioritization Frameworks

Risk assessment approaches:

- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)** - Standardized severity scoring
- **EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)** - Likelihood of exploitation
- **Asset Criticality** - Importance of affected systems
- **Business Impact** - Potential consequences of exploitation
- **Threat Context** - Active exploitation in the wild

### Remediation Strategies

Addressing vulnerabilities through:

- **Patching** - Applying vendor-provided fixes
- **Configuration Changes** - Modifying settings to mitigate risk
- **Compensating Controls** - Implementing alternative protections
- **Acceptance** - Documenting decision to accept risk
- **Transfer** - Shifting risk through insurance or contracts

### Common Challenges

Organizations struggle with:

- **Volume of Vulnerabilities** - Too many findings to address
- **False Positives** - Scanner inaccuracies requiring validation
- **Patch Management** - Testing and deploying updates safely
- **Legacy Systems** - Unsupported systems that can't be patched
- **Resource Constraints** - Limited staff and budget
- **Business Continuity** - Maintaining operations during remediation

### Metrics and Reporting

Key performance indicators:

- **Time to Discovery** - How quickly vulnerabilities are found
- **Time to Remediation** - How quickly vulnerabilities are fixed
- **Vulnerability Backlog** - Number of unaddressed vulnerabilities
- **Critical Vulnerability Count** - High-risk issues remaining
- **Scan Coverage** - Percentage of assets being assessed
- **Remediation Rate** - Percentage of vulnerabilities addressed

### Integration with Other Processes

Vulnerability management connects to:

- **Asset Management** - Understanding what needs protection
- **Configuration Management** - Ensuring secure baselines
- **Change Management** - Coordinating remediation activities
- **Risk Management** - Informing overall risk posture
- **Incident Response** - Addressing exploited vulnerabilities
- **Compliance** - Meeting regulatory requirements

### Emerging Trends

Vulnerability management evolution:

- **Continuous Monitoring** - Real-time vulnerability assessment
- **Attack Surface Management** - External vulnerability discovery
- **DevSecOps Integration** - Shifting left in development lifecycle
- **Prioritization Automation** - AI-driven risk scoring
- **Cloud-Native Scanning** - Container and serverless vulnerability assessment
- **Threat-Based Prioritization** - Focusing on actively exploited vulnerabilities

Effective vulnerability management requires a systematic, risk-based approach that balances technical findings with business context to maximize security impact with available resources.
